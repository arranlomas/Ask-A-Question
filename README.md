# Ask-A-Question
App to send a question

Press the add button, type your question and press send

You and other users of the app can vote on the questions (one vote per question per device)

The latest apk can be downloaded from this link: 

https://github.com/arranlomas/Ask-A-Question/raw/master/release-apk/1.0.0.apk


To install you must go to:
settings -> security -> check Unknown sources (also recommend you check Verify apps) -> open the apk and follow hints to install


This app is used as a sandbox for me to play around, we use it with some collegues to add questions for our discussions.

DO NOT PUT PRIVATE INFORMATION ON THE APP - the questions posted are visible to anyone that downloads the apk, do not post private info
